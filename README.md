                Well, from an individual point of view, avoiding leaking data is futile, which requires a lot of technical means and is not useful every time. The only way is to refuse all internet devices, otherwise Internet companies will always get your personal data.

               Just creating a password for your device is not enough, you can also create different passwords for your other applications. Setting up two-factor authentication (2FA) or multi-factor authentication (MFA) means that even if someone finds your password, they probably won’t have the additional factor they need to get in.

                Your social media apps, games, and weather apps are interested in your data … and they may be collecting quite a lot of it. Getting rid of those random apps on your phone that you never use can be a powerful way to detox your digital self. If the application asks you for a data access, think about whether it really needs this permission?
